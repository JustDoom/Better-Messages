    # each other. Set to -1 to disable which will make the message always show up. Not available for world changes yet.

    # If you want to not send it to the activating player add "ignore-user" after the audience type. This is
    # useful for having a separate join message for the player and the server.

    # For only sending it to the people with a certain permission, add "permission:{permission}" after the audience type.
    # For this to work do not include any spaces.
    # Example: "server|permission:custom.join"
    # You can also combined the two, "server|ignore-user|permission:custom.join"
